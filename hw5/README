HW5 by Nikita Georgiou

The purpose of this project is to impliment a simple chat between a client and
a server. The server asks the user to provide a username to chat with and an
optional port to bind to. It then waits for a client to connect, and chats with
them. If the client disconnects or is unreachable for whatever reason, the
server resumes listening for more clients. 

The client similarly asks for a username and port, but also asks for an
address to connect to, defaulting to localhost. The port field, while not 
intentional, can also be left blank. This will almost guarintee a failure
to connect to the server, however. 

The communication library defines a set of functions for the client and server
to use. Since their codebase has plenty of overlap, both programs share
one header file for intercommunication. Server or client specific functions
are made evident by their name scheme, eg "server_socket_setup."

the common library defines (currently one) general purpose helper functions 
useful for homework.
